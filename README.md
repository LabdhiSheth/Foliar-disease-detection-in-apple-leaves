# Foliar-disease-detection-in-apple-leaves
Kaggle competition 2021
The competition revolves around Foliar (leaf) diseases in apple orchards which  pose a major threat to the overall productivity and quality of apple.
There are computer vision based models which help detect the diseased leaf but there are large variations in the visual symptoms of a single leaf disease across different cultivators. The reasons can be because of the different conditions under which the image is captured, for example: the difference in natural and image capturing environments where the characteristics of the leaf like the leaf color and leaf morphology, age of the infected tissues changes due to different light illumination during imaging.


Plant Pathology 2020-FGVC7 challenge competition had a pilot dataset of 3,651 RGB images of foliar disease of apples. For Plant Pathology 2021-FGVC8, we have
1. Approximately 23,000 high-quality RGB images of apple foliar diseases
2. A large expert-annotated disease dataset. 
3. Test images has 3 images in it
4. Train_csv file has two columns one being images and other labels
5. A submission_csv has been provided as a sample

Thus there are 18.6k images and 2 csv files provided to us.
